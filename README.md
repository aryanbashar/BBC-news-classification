# BBC-news-classification
The goal of this case study is to use different text classification techniques in order to predict a category of a given news article depending on the content written about. We will be using the publicly available database from the BBC which is made up of 2225 articles labeled under 5 categories of business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech. This will follow the Kaggle Competition from March 2, 2019 and where the data was downloaded from. The following notebook will go through exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, model building and training, and comparison with supervised learning.
